          Terms and Conditions for Terminus Mechanical Keyboards
        </h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Welcome to Terminus, the home of high-quality mechanical keyboards
            and accessories. By accessing our website and purchasing products
            from us, you are agreeing to the following Terms and Conditions.
            These terms apply to all users of our website, including those
            simply browsing and those making purchases. By using our website,
            you confirm that you are at least 18 years old or accessing the site
            under the supervision and consent of a parent or legal guardian. If
            you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions, you should not use
            our website or purchase products from Terminus.
          </p>
          <p>
            All products displayed on our website are subject to availability
            and may be withdrawn at any time without notice. We make every
            effort to ensure that product descriptions, images, and details are
            accurate and up to date, but minor variations in colour, design, or
            packaging may occur. Product images are for illustrative purposes
            only and actual products may differ slightly. Prices are displayed
            in GBP (¬£) and include VAT where applicable. Delivery charges are
            not included in the product price and will be shown at checkout. We
            reserve the right to change prices, product information, and
            promotions at any time without notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            When placing an order, you agree to provide accurate and complete
            information. Once an order is placed, you will receive a
            confirmation email acknowledging receipt of your order. This email
            is not acceptance of your order; a contract is only formed once your
            order has been dispatched. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel
            any order for reasons including, but not limited to, suspected
            fraud, product unavailability, pricing errors, or failure to comply
            with these Terms and Conditions. If we cancel your order after
            payment has been made, a full refund will be issued.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment must be made in full at the time of placing an order. We
            accept payment by credit card, debit card, and any other methods
            displayed on our website at the time of purchase. All payments are
            processed securely, but Terminus is not responsible for any
            third-party payment processing issues, including unauthorised
            transactions or payment provider errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to dispatch all orders as quickly as possible, but delivery
            times are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. Factors such as
            weather, courier delays, or customs clearance may affect delivery
            times, and we are not responsible for delays outside our control.
            Deliveries will be made to the address provided during checkout, and
            it is your responsibility to ensure all delivery details are
            correct. If delivery is unsuccessful due to an incorrect address,
            additional charges may apply. For international orders, you are
            responsible for any customs duties, taxes, or import fees imposed by
            your country‚Äôs authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may return unused
            products in their original condition and packaging within 30 days of
            delivery for a refund. Returns must be authorised in advance, and
            you will be responsible for the cost of return postage unless the
            item is faulty. Refunds will only be processed once the returned
            item has been received and inspected. Items that have been used,
            damaged, or altered are not eligible for return. Custom-built and
            personalised products are non-returnable unless they are faulty.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Terminus mechanical keyboards come with a one-year limited
            warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This
            warranty does not cover damage caused by misuse, accidents,
            unauthorised modifications, improper storage, or normal wear and
            tear. To make a warranty claim, you will need to provide proof of
            purchase and details of the fault. We reserve the right to repair,
            replace, or refund any defective product at our discretion. The
            warranty is only valid for the original purchaser and is
            non-transferable.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, Terminus will not be liable
            for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from
            the use of our products or website. This includes, but is not
            limited to, loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption.
            Our total liability for any claim, whether in contract, tort, or
            otherwise, will not exceed the total amount paid for the product
            giving rise to the claim. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions
            limits your statutory rights as a consumer under applicable law.
